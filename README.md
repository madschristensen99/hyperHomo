# HyperHomo: Encrypted Trading Strategies for Hyperliquid

HyperHomo is a revolutionary platform that enables privacy-preserving trading strategies for Hyperliquid perpetuals using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology running in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This combination provides verifiably private operations for secure, confidential trading.

## Project Overview

HyperHomo allows traders to:

1. Create encrypted trading strategies with private parameters
2. Execute trades on Hyperliquid without revealing strategy details
3. Verify strategy execution through TEE attestation
4. Maintain complete privacy while trading on public blockchain networks

## Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

### 1. FHE Server (Rust)

The FHE server is built with Rust and leverages the TFHE library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption operations. It runs within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to provide hardware-level security guarantees.

Key features:
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption for secure computation on encrypted data
- Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for verifiable privacy guarantees
- RESTful API for strategy creation and execution
- Encrypted bounds checking for trading signals

### 2. Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)

A modern, responsive web interface that allows users to:
- Browse available encrypted trading strategies
- Deploy strategies to their accounts
- Place orders using encrypted parameters
- Monitor performance with real-time updates

## How It Works

1. **Strategy Creation**: Traders create strategies with encrypted upper and lower bounds
2. **Secure Execution**: The FHE server performs computations on encrypted data without ever seeing the actual values
3. **TEE Verification**: The Trusted Execution Environment ensures that the code execution cannot be tampered with
4. **Private Trading**: Trading signals are generated based on encrypted comparisons, maintaining strategy confidentiality

## Why TEE + FHE?

By running our FHE operations within a Trusted Execution Environment, we provide multiple layers of security:

1. **FHE Layer**: Ensures that data remains encrypted during computation
2. **TEE Layer**: Provides hardware-level isolation and attestation that the code is running as expected
3. **Combined Security**: Even if one layer is compromised, the other continues to protect user data

This dual-layer approach makes HyperHomo uniquely secure for high-value trading strategies that require both privacy and verifiability.

## Technical Details

### FHE Implementation

We use the TFHE (Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus) library for encrypted operations, specifically:
- Encrypted integer comparisons for strategy bounds checking
- Secure key generation and management
- Optimized homomorphic operations for performance

### TEE Integration

Our TEE implementation ensures:
- Memory encryption and isolation
- Remote attestation capabilities
- Protection against side-channel attacks
- Verifiable execution guarantees

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Rust (for development)
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Running the FHE Server

```bash
cd fhe-server
docker build -t fhe-server .
DOCKER_IMAGE=fhe-server docker-compose up
```

### Accessing the Frontend

Simply open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser or serve it using a local web server.

## Security Considerations

While HyperHomo provides strong privacy guarantees through FHE and TEE technologies, users should be aware that:

1. Key management remains the responsibility of the user
2. Network traffic patterns may still reveal some information about trading activity
3. The security of the system depends on the underlying TEE implementation
